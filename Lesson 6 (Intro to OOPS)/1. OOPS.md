#  # Procedural versus object-oriented programming

# Objects are defined by characteristics and actions

Here is a reminder of what is a characteristic and what is an action.

Objects are defined by their characteristics and their actions

# Characteristics and actions in English grammar

You can also think about characteristics and actions is in terms of English grammar. A characteristic corresponds to a noun and an action corresponds to a verb.

Let's pick something from the real world: a dog. Some characteristics of the dog include the dog's weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. Some actions a dog can take include to bark, to run, to bite, and to eat. These are all verbs.

# Class, object, method, and attribut

# Object-oriented programming (OOP) vocabulary

-   _Class_: A blueprint consisting of methods and attributes.
-   _Object_: An  _instance_  of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, or a blue shirt. However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.
-   _Attribute_: A descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.
-   _Method_: An action that a class or object could take.
-   _OOP_: A commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming.
-   Encapsulation: One of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details, much like how the  `scikit-learn`  package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

In English, you might hear an attribute described as a  _property_,  _description_,  _feature_,  _quality_,  _trait_, or  _characteristic_. All of these are saying the same thing.
Here is a reminder of how a class, an object, attributes, and methods relate to each other.

# Object-oriented programming syntax
# Function versus method

A function and a method look very similar. They both use the  `def`  keyword. They also have inputs and return outputs. The difference is that a method is inside of a class whereas a function is outside of a class.

# What is  `self`?

If you instantiate two objects, how does Python differentiate between these two objects?

```
shirt_one = Shirt('red', 'S', 'short-sleeve', 15)
shirt_two = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 20)

```

That's where  `self`  comes into play. If you call the  `change_price`  method on  `shirt_one`, how does Python know to change the price of  `shirt_one`  and not of  `shirt_two`?

```
shirt_one.change_price(12)

```

Behind the scenes, Python is calling the  `change_price`  method:

```
    def change_price(self, new_price):

        self.price = new_price

```

`Self`  tells Python where to look in the computer's memory for the  `shirt_one`  object. Then, Python changes the price of the  `shirt_one`  object. When you call the  `change_price`  method,  `shirt_one.change_price(12)`,  `self`  is implicitly passed in.

The word  `self`  is just a convention. You could actually use any other name as long as you are consisten, but you should use  `self`  to avoid confusing people.
